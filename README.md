SmartBugs is an extensible platform with a uniform interface to tools
that analyse blockchain programs for weaknesses and other properties.

## Features

- *20 supported tools, 3 modes* for analysing Solidity source
  code, deployment bytecode, and runtime code.

- *Modular integration of analysers.* All it takes to add
  a new tool is a Docker image encapsulating the tool and a few lines
  in a config file. To make the output accessible in a standardised
  format, add a small Python script.
  
- *Parallel, randomised, restartable execution* of the tasks for the
  optimal use of resources when performing a bulk analysis. If
  execution is interrupted, it can be resumed by running SmartBugs
  with the same parameters again.

- *Standardised output format.* Scripts parse and normalise the output
  of the tools to allow for an automated analysis of the results across
  tools.

- *Automatic download of an appropriate Solidity compiler* matching
  the contract under analysis, and injection into the Docker image.

- *Output of results in SARIF format,* for integration into Github
  workflows.

- *Platform independence:* SmartBugs has been tested with Linux, MacOS
  and Windows.

## Installation

SmartBugs has been tested with Linux, MacOS and Windows. It depends on
Docker and Python.  For details, see the [installation
instructions](doc/installation.md).

## Usage

SmartBugs provides a uniform command-line interface to all tools.  Two
utilities allow the user to reparse analysis results at any time after
the analysis and to extract the data into a form suitable for a
database.

As an example, the following commands analyse the contracts in the `samples` folder with all available tools and write the parsed output to `results.csv`.

```console
./smartbugs -t all -f samples/* --timeout 600
./reparse results
./results2csv -p results > results.csv
```

> **Note:** The following script is intended for testing purposes. It may not function as expected in certain scenarios.
If you want to execute several analyses one after another, you can use the
`smartbugs-multi` helper script.  Separate the options for each run with `--`.
Each run works as an independent SmartBugs execution, allowing you to analyze
different contracts or configurations separately.

```console
./smartbugs-multi -t slither -f contracts/FirstSplit -- -t mythril -f contracts/SecondSplit1 -f contracts/SecondSplit2
```

To visualise these results you can generate an HTML report:

```console
./generate_report --input_folder results --output report.html
```

The command reads all CSV files from the chosen folder and
creates a self‑contained HTML page with tables and graphs
summarising execution time and detected vulnerabilities.

For details, see the [usage notes](doc/usage.md) and the [SmartBugs wiki](https://github.com/smartbugs/smartbugs/wiki).

## Smart Contract Datasets
