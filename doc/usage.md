# Usage

SmartBugs provides a command-line interface. Run it without arguments for a short description.
For details, see [SmartBugs' wiki](https://github.com/smartbugs/smartbugs/wiki/The-command-line-interface).

Dynamic scheduling of additional tools is enabled by default. Use `--no-dynamic` to run only the specified tools.

```console
./smartbugs
usage: smartbugs [-c FILE] [-t TOOL [TOOL ...]] [-f PATTERN [PATTERN ...]] [--main] [--runtime]
                 [--processes N] [--timeout N] [--cpu-quota N] [--mem-limit MEM] [--fuzz-mode MODE]
                 [--no-dynamic][--runid ID] [--results DIR] [--log FILE] [--overwrite] [--json] 
                 [--sarif] [--quiet] [--version] [-h]
...
```

**Example:** To analyse the Solidity files in the `samples` directory with Mythril, use the command

```console
./smartbugs -t mythril -f samples/*.sol --processes 2 --mem-limit 4g --timeout 600
```

The options tell SmartBugs to run two processes in parallel, with a memory limit of 4GB and max. 10 minutes computation time per task.
By default, the results are placed in the local directory `results`.
If a tool is run with additional arguments, these arguments are used as
a subfolder name inside the contract's directory so runs with different
arguments do not overwrite each other.
Fuzzing tools such as ConFuzzius honor the `--fuzz-mode` option, which
controls their execution time (`fast`, `normal`, or `accurate`).

Follow-up analyses scheduled dynamically by SmartBugs may also define a
timeout category (`fast`, `normal`, or `accurate`). The concrete durations for
these categories are configured in `sb/cfg.py` through the `FOLLOWUP_TIMEOUTS`
dictionary. Adjust those values to increase or decrease the allotted time for
follow-up runs or to introduce new timeout profiles.


## Utility programs

**`reparse`** can be used to parse analysis results and extract relevant information, without rerunning the analysis.
This may be useful either when you did not specify the option `--json` or `--sarif` during analysis, or when you want to parse old analysis results with an updated parser.

```console
./reparse
usage: reparse [-h] [--sarif] [--processes N] [-v] DIR [DIR ...]
```

**`results2csv`** generates a csv file from the results, suitable e.g. for a database.

```console
./results2csv
usage: results2csv [-h] [-p] [-v] [-f FIELD [FIELD ...]] [-x FIELD [FIELD ...]] DIR [DIR ...]
```

The following commands analyse `SimpleDAO.sol` with all available tools and write the parsed output to `results.csv`.
`reparse` is necessary in this example, since `smartbugs` is called without the options `--json` and `--sarif`, so SmartBugs doesn't parse during the analysis.
`results2csv` collects the outputs in the folder `results` and writes for each analysed contract one line of comma-separated values to standard output (redirected to `results.csv`).
The option `-p` tells `results2csv` to format the lists of findings, errors etc. as Postgres arrays; without the option, the csv file is suitable for spreadsheet programs.

```console
./smartbugs -t all -f samples/SimpleDAO.sol
./reparse results
./results2csv -p results > results.csv
```

You can then create an HTML report summarising the CSV files:

```console
./generate_report --input_folder results --output report.html
```

The report lists each contractâ€™s classified vulnerabilities with line numbers and the tools that detected them.
