#NOTE: eThor has been added in the orchestrator, but then commented out because I think it may not be necessary given the contexts in which it should be used

#NOTE: For now, Semgrep and solhint have not been orchestrated. I need to investigate the results of the original smartbugs to determine exactly if and where they should be placed

#NOTE: sfuzz CURRENTLY ON HOLD. I have to determine if i need another fuzzer

#TODO Orchestrate Oyente

#TODO Fare dei test sui 4 split utilizzando smartbugs originale con tutti i tool
